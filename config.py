#This is a config file to configure every module that will ever need global variables

#begin config

x = 12

y = 14

z = 'foo'

def summation (a, b):
	return a+b

sumconfig = summation(x, y)


#end of config file



#THREE IMPORTANT RULES FOR ESF DEVELOPERS

#BARE IN MIND WE WILL OFTEN MODIFY CONFIG FROM TIME TO TIME SO WE CAN BE ABLE TO STORE MANY METHODS AS WELL AS MANY VARIABLES

#DEVELOPERS MUST NOTICE THAT CONFIG OR cfg IS A CRUCIAL ASSET TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE

#WHEN MAKING COMMITS TO CONFIG or cfg TAKE NOTICE OF THE OTHER MODULES RELYING ON IT
